                    Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with computers and technology. I was always
                    tinkering with the family computer and trying out new things I would see on forums.
                    When I eventually saved up enough to build my own PC, I was able to delve further into
                    the internet. Since then, I've discovered my <b>passion for programming</b> and have continued
                    to pursue this career path.

                    In 2019, I enrolled at the University of Nevada - Las Vegas. I pursued a <b>Bachelor of Science
                    in Computer Science.</b> During my academic career, I had the privilege of interning at Credit One
                    Bank as a <b>Full Stack Developer Intern</b>. My time there was a great learning experience and allowed
                    me to peer into what my professional career will look like. In addition, I also worked as a student
                    worker at the UNLV's Department of Geoscience as a <b>Student Web Developer.</b> During my time there, I
                    was able to educate myself on creating webpages that were accessibility to those using assistive
                    technologies. After graduating UNLV, I accepted a position at Raytheon as a <b>Software Engineer.</b>&nbsp;
                    During my time there, I was able to work with an incredibly smart team that I was able to learn a lot
                    from. Sadly, due to business reorganizations, my position was let go and I was laid off. I am 
                    currently open to any opportunities that are presented. Feel free to contact me with any offers.
